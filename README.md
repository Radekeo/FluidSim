# Moradeke Onamusi Fluid Simulator

## Overview

### Fluid Simulation Project

A C++ and OpenGL-based 3D application that creates and visualizes fluid simulations

### Features
- Real-time, interactive fluid simulation
- Interface for control of fluid properties

### Approach
- Modify particle system from ase-labs
- Apply algorithm such as Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics for making particles act more like fluids
    - Reference Papers: http://www.ligum.umontreal.ca/Clavet-2005-PVFS/pvfs.pdf, 
- Implement code for animation algorithm
- Make a gui that takes input for different fluid properties which would affect fluid behaviours in the simulation
